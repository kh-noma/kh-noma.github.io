            <h1>MINNIE</h1>
            <h3>The Diva of NYUAD! 🎬✨</h3>

                <p>
                    Minnie isn’t just a cat – she is a star! This charming, attention-loving cat thrives in the spotlight, especially when NYUAD students have their cameras only on her. Whether it is a casual phone recording or a student film project, Minnie is always ready to steal the show with her confident poses and expressions.
                    She loves being the center of attention, gracefully meowing for admiration, and making sure all eyes are on her. But being a star isn’t always easy – especially with Black Cat Larry constantly trying to share her spotlight! Minnie won’t have it, and their rivalry often leads to hilarious debates over who truly rules the campus.
                    Despite her diva tendencies, Minnie is an affectionate and fun-loving cat who enjoys the company of students, thriving in their admiration, and, of course, getting filmed from her best angles. If you're looking for the true main character of NYUAD’s community, look no further – Minnie was born for the role!
                    Lights, camera, Minnie! 🎥🐾✨

                Larry isn’t just any black cat—she’s a true icon, always ready for the spotlight and never caught without her signature elegance. Confident and photogenic, she walks around campus like a runway model, making sure everyone admires her fur and mesmerizing eyes.
                But fame isn’t easy when there’s competition, and Larry’s biggest rival is none other than Minnie! These two attention-loving stars are constantly battling for the main character position, each trying to outshine the other in front of NYUAD students. Whether it’s posing for photos, lounging in the perfect sunspot near D2, or demanding affection at exactly the right moment, Larry makes sure she always looks flawless — because in her world, perfection is key.
                Despite their rivalry, Larry and Minnie share one thing in common: they both love being adored. If you ever spot Larry striking a pose or meowing for attention, don’t hold back — she expects the compliments, and trust us, she deserves them.
                Bow down to Queen Larry—the feline fashionista and forever star of NYUAD! 🌟🐈‍⬛✨

            ORANGE

        <h3>The Gourmet Critic of NYUAD 🍗🐾</h3>

                Orange isn’t just a cat—he’s a food connoisseur, a seasoned expert in student snacks, and the self-proclaimed inspector of all things edible. Every day, he roams the campus with one mission in mind: to find the tastiest treats that NYUAD students have to offer.
                With a confident stride and an expectant gaze, Orange approaches students with a clear demand—Where’s my food? He firmly believes that sharing is caring, and nothing disappoints him more than empty hands. If a student dares to have no snacks prepared for him, Orange will let out an exasperated sigh (or a dramatic tail flick) and grumble about how NYUAD students are getting way too broke these days.
                From cafeteria leftovers to late-night study snacks, he knows all the best meal spots on campus and isn’t shy about making his presence known when food is involved. But don’t think you can trick him with just any offering—Orange has refined taste, and only the best scraps will earn his approval.
                So next time you see Orange staring at you with judgmental eyes, just know—he’s not mad, he’s just disappointed. 🍕🐈✨
