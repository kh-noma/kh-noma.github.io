Process

The development of this website started with defining the personalities of NYUAD’s campus cats and bringing them to life through website. The process involved:
1. Research & Planning: Understanding how to structure the website for good user experience.
2. Wireframing & Design: Creating a simple layout with clear navigation.
3. Content Creation: Writing character descriptions and designing visuals using creative generative AI that complement the film’s theme.

Testing & Refinement: Reviewing usability, fixing bugs.

Reflection/Evaluation

The final website shows the essence of cats' personalities in an engaging way. The navigation is smooth with the storytelling elements. I think the initial goals of intuitive design and clean aesthetic are met, but there are potential improvements (adding more user interactions and a blog section with audience feedback). Overall, this project was rewarding and challenging, with web development, storytelling, and creative design.
